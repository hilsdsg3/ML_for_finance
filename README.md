## Demo

Building a model with BigQuery ML

- Questions of financial modeling

What data do I have ?
What do others have ? Public or private
Does the freshness of my data matter a little or a lot ?
What assumptions is my model taking ? Retested very often
Is there a combination of things I could model ?

- Case study : Moddelling CPU Performance by vendor with BigQuery

Given raw inputs such s vendor, max_mhz, os .... can you predict the benchmark score. The prediction model setup is linear regression with BigQuery ML.
